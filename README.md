# Example Rails App with GraphQL

An example application based on the Rails Getting Started guide and incrementally adding GraphQL features.

Start with the `start` branch and add some example data. Then progress through the stages from branches `1` to `9`. Refer to the steps in `steps_all.md` for some (pretty minimal) notes on what has changed and example GraphQL queries to run.
